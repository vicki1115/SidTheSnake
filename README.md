# SidTheSnake  üêçüçéüîπ
A twist on the oh-so-classic Snake game!

# Introduction
The original plan that my partner and I began with is much different than the end result, although I must say that we are both proud with what we accomplished. The original plan included the backgrounds changing  and having images involved rather than just shapes, but about two or three days into the project, we realized that we bit off more than we could chew. However, in the proposal, we stated that our metrics of success with this project would be that the snake would _grow as it collects the food_, which in this case is the apple. We also felt the need to make sure that this wasn't just any Snake game, but one with twists. In this case, the twists that we implemented in the project were obstacles, called **"poison"**, which, if the snake came in contact with, it would collapse into just the head of the snake and lose all of the **"apples"**, or points, it had accumulated up until that point. At each moment that the snake interacts with either the apple or the poison, the poison(s) move elsewhere on the canvas, making it harder for the player to dodge, thus making the game a little bit more difficult but more entertaining as well, since in this version of the game, not only are you trying to collect points, but also dodge the obstacles. You can imagine, as well, that as the player accumulates more apples and grows, taking up more space, it becomes harder and harder to avoid the obstacles. 

# Instructions
**Use the arrow keys** to collect as many **apples** _(red)_ as you possibly can, while avoiding **(1)** the **poison** _(blue)_, **(2)** the outer boundaries of the canvas, and **(3)** avoiding collapsing into yourself _(the body of the snake)_ at all time. 

# Credits
Lorhena and I communicated effieciently during the entire duration of the project, and would divide up more research on using new tools, such as constructor function, than anything else. We also were tasked with coming up with different elements, such as the snake itself and the apples and poison, but quickly realized doing that individually would only cause confusion, so we would utilize the Zoom platform multiple times a week in order to brainstorm and further develop our plans

It is also very important to emphasize that **"The Coding Train" YouTube channel** was extraordinarily helpful in presenting new tools _(constructor function)_ as well as providing us with the skeleton of our project which we built upon. **This project was heavily built on that**. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM&t=557s

In addition to The Coding Train's YouTube channel, meeting with **Professor Sherman** was also extremely helpful because we would know what functions and concepts to use, but would have a hard time applying them to the actual project in a way that would be useful to our goals. He would walk us through it and made it clear to us what our next steps should look like while never giving us the answers himself, but rather helping us understand and aapply the concepts.

_**The project would not be the same without these resources!**_
